# Voltclock
Arduino clock with 10V meters


Code:
---------------
Provided is the .ino File for the Arduino IDE.
Additionally needed are the following arduino libraries:
- DCF77 Library
- Time Library


Summary:
---------------
The Voltclock is a small desktop clock which consists of five 10V meters to display the following data:
- Hours
- Minutes
- Seconds
- Days
- Months

The time is adjusted by using a DCF77 receiver.


Hardware needed:
------------------
- Arduino. I used an Arduino  Uno
- Five 10V meters like those -> http://cdn-reichelt.de/bilder/web/artikel_ws/D100/EQB_72V.jpg
- Transistor Array like ULN2004 to power the meters.
- DCF Receiver. I used the one from Pollin -> http://www.pollin.de/shop/dt/NTQ5OTgxOTk-/Bausaetze_Module/Module/DCF_Empfangsmodul_DCF1.html
